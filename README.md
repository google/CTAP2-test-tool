## CTAP2 test tool

The test suite intents to make it easier for developers to find bugs in their
CTAP2 implementation.

### Disclaimer
Those tests reflect the author's interpretation of the specification. It is not
to be confused with certification by the FIDO Alliance. Please check the
[FIDO Alliance web page](https://fidoalliance.org/) for more information.

### How to install

The build system is bazel. Please make sure you have all dependencies installed.
Example command for Ubuntu:

```shell
apt-get install bazel libudev-dev autotools-dev autoconf automake libtool
```

On your first run, the build system will fetch all other necessary libraries
using git.

### How to run

Running the tool without comments lists all avaiable devices. Select the device
you want to test by passing `--token_path`. If only one CTAP2 compatible device
is plugged in, you can simply run:

```shell
./run.sh
```

For more control, try i.e.:

```shell
bazel run //:fido2_conformance
bazel run //:fido2_conformance -- --token_path=/dev/hidraw0
```

:warning: Please do not plug in other security keys with the same product ID, or
the tool might contact the wrong device during testing.

While running the test tool, you will be prompted to touch or replug your
security key multiple times, to test various features.

### Supported features

At the moment, we only support USB HID as a transport. We test the commands from
[CTAP 2.0](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-ps-20190130/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-ps-20190130.pdf),
but plan to add tests for supported extensions and
[CTAP 2.1](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido2/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.1-rd-20191217.html).
