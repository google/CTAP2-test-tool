## Results

Results are stored in JSON files and generated after successful test tool runs.
It contains information about tests and other findings. Check the `results`
directory and look for your product ID.

### Contributing your own results

After finishing all tests, you see a printed summary of your results in your
terminal, and a report file is created in the `results` directory. You can
contribute this file to our collection of results with a pull request!

### First iteration of results

In a first iteration before open sourcing, the results found in
`initial_results` were generated and shared with the respective vendors. They
are included here for transparency.
